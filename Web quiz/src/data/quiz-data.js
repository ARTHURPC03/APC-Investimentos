    answers: [
      <span>Standard class components have state, lifecycle hooks, and refs.</span>, 
      <span>A PureComponent is just like a class component, but handles shouldComponentUpdate for you, with a shallow check for changes in props or state. This allows for a performance boost by preventing unnecessary rerenders.</span>,
      <span>Functional components are presentational; they don't have access to state or lifecycle hooks, and can't use refs.</span>,
      <span>All of the above.</span>
